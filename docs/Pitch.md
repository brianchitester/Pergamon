Pergamon Pitch

Pitch: "The Personal Library OS"
In an age of algorithmic feeds and fleeting digital content, our bookshelves are still our most personal archives — but they’re stuck in the analog world.

We’re building the first visual cataloging platform for readers, powered by computer vision and AI. Snap a photo of your shelf, and we instantly return a beautifully organized digital library:

📚 Auto-tagged by genre, language, and author
🌐 Enriched with Goodreads links and summaries
🧠 Stats and insights on your reading habits
🔄 Exportable to JSON, CSV, or synced with Notion
☁️ Secure, private, and portable — hosted on Vercel + Supabase

This isn't just a book tracker. It’s a personal knowledge graph, starting with your shelf.

Our tech turns passive stacks into structured data — instantly. No barcode scanning. No manual entry. Just one photo.

Market: Over 400 million avid readers globally. Tens of millions collect, annotate, and share their libraries online. No one’s built a true visual-first cataloging layer for them. Until now.

Future vision: → Semantic search for that one book someone loaned you 3 years ago → AI-curated shelf reordering → Social shelf sharing for discovery, trade, and legacy

We're launching with a Vercel-powered web app, and laying the foundation for a mobile product that lets every book lover carry their library in their pocket — beautifully organized, browsable, and searchable.

🏛️ What is Pergamon?
Pergamon (or Pergamum) was an ancient Greek city in what is now modern-day Turkey. During the Hellenistic period, it became a major center of learning, culture, and science, second only to Alexandria in terms of intellectual prestige.
It was home to the Library of Pergamon, which reportedly held over 200,000 scrolls and rivaled the Library of Alexandria in size and influence. According to legend, when Egypt banned the export of papyrus to Pergamon (to stop their growth), Pergamon developed parchment (from pergamena charta) as an alternative — literally inventing a new way to preserve knowledge.
