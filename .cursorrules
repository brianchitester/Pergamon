# Cursor Rules

- Use TypeScript throughout.
- Prefer React Server Components unless state/hook needed.
- JSDoc every exported function.
- Tailwind class order: display → position → box model → typography → color → misc.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits: <type>(scope): <subject>.
- Use branches to make pull requests and include a description of the changes.
- Use the following commit types:
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - perf: A code change that improves performance
  - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
