# Cursor Rules
- Use TypeScript throughout.
- Prefer React Server Components unless state/hook needed.
- JSDoc every exported function.
- Tailwind class order: display → position → box model → typography → color → misc.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits: <type>(scope): <subject>.
- PR titles must reference an open issue/TODO.
